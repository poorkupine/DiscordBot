# DiscordBot
The repository for my Discord bot hobby project

I primarily use it to test different features of the discord API and to practice C#




# What it does

The current interation moves users to different voice channels using the /move command

Previous iterations (before uploading to Github) could download images and add sounds using FFMpeg


# Commands

/move

- This command iterates through all the users currently in voice channels and moves them to another channel
