# DiscordBot
The repository for my Discord bot hobby project

I primarily use it to test different features of the Discord API and to practice C#

# What it does

The current interation moves users to different voice channels using the /move command

Previous versions (before uploading to Github) could download images and add sounds using FFMpeg


# Commands

/move

- This command iterates through all the users currently in voice channels and moves them to another channel


# What is next

Add more commands to bring back features from past prototypes
 - Downloading images
 - Manipulating those images using FFMpeg
